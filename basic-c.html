                        <h2>What is Competitive Programming?</h2>
                        <p>Competitive programming is a mind sport usually held over the Internet or a local network, involving participants trying to program according to provided specifications. Contestants are referred to as sport programmers. Competitive programming is recognized and supported by several multinational software and Internet companies, which often hold contests to identify and recruit potential employees. Competitive programming is also a popular academic and extracurricular activity at many universities and secondary schools.</p>
                        <h2>What is C Programming?</h2>
                        <p>C is a general-purpose, procedural, imperative computer programming language developed in 1972 by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories to develop the UNIX operating system. C is the most widely used computer language. It keeps fluctuating at number one scale of popularity along with Java programming language, which is also equally popular and most widely used among modern software programmers.</p>
                        <h2>Why C Programming?</h2>
                        <p>C is a middle-level language, as it comprises both high-level and low-level language features. The language was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, to provide low-level access to memory, to provide language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, and to require minimal run-time support. These goals made C an ideal language for system programming in the 1970s and 1980s, when it was the most widely used systems programming language. Today, C is still one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has become a widely used professional language for various reasons:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>C is a structured language</li>
                            <li>C is a portable language</li>
                            <li>C is a powerful language</li>
                            <li>C is a fast language</li>
                            <li>C is a simple language</li>
                            <li>C is a rich language</li>
                            <li>C is a standard language</li>
                        </ul>
